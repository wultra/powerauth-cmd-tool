# PowerAuth Command-Line Tool Usage

This brief document serves as a documentation of the reference PowerAuth Client - a simple utility connecting to the standard RESTful API. The utility simulates a mobile device on desktop - you can use it for simple integration testing.

## Download PowerAuth Reference Client

You can download the latest `powerauth-java-cmd.jar` at the releases page:

- [PowerAuth Command-Line Tool Releases](https://github.com/wultra/powerauth-cmd-tool/releases)

## Installing Bouncy Castle

Before you can run the utility from the command-line, you need to register [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/) JCE provider in your JRE.

Please follow our [Bouncy Castle installation tutorial](https://github.com/wultra/powerauth-server/blob/develop/docs/Installing-Bouncy-Castle.md).

## PowerAuth Client Config File

_Note: You must create this file before you can use the utility. Obtain the information from the PowerAuth Admin interface._

Client configuration file is required for the correct function of the command-line utility. It contains the same information that would be bundled inside a mobile app after download from the application marketplace. The file stores application key, application secret and master server public key in a following format:

```json
{
  "applicationName": "PowerAuth Reference Client",
  "applicationKey": "ivGlm/hl6rn9lSaD4qMgGw==",
  "applicationSecret": "bI5pNbDdAXWUr/UQY5+Tpg==",
  "masterPublicKey": "BO4+eqJPQTldjcV9G36dGiagsOHzgKgWz5uPuJKYwvIakbFmfWah1N4GXmBOS8aBEwQ+BcV04LL+OBBY0QS1bvg="
}
```

You must obtain the values for this file from the PowerAuth Admin interface:

## PowerAuth Client Status File

_Note: You should not create this file yourself. The utility creates it for you._

This file is automatically created by the utility after you call the `create` method. It keeps the current PowerAuth Client activation status information. In other words, client status file contains everything that a mobile application would store after it was paired with the user account.

```json
{
  "activationId" : "cebb3ae6-f774-4b74-8020-f7b4da64de8f",
  "serverPublicKey" : "BKVanyqfLG2MxVwMt/LhmFliqPpHxVhtU3PEMG9FOIeJFkPAQjHpije029//S+bOprC4j6a8DMukxfoYkCFfLjU=",
  "counter" : 10,
  "ctrData" : "oJoq6ds50Z+udWcY6hnbig==",
  "encryptedDevicePrivateKey" : "HxRPkVVTM3QL+hecOY6cwQNvgNzvp2GbvvQ7cAOUXxzAk1dDaZVh1hd+2k18ZHn2",
  "signatureBiometryKey" : "4Kb+7AO49ZHOpA4vtYzZGA==",
  "signatureKnowledgeKeyEncrypted" : "i0LTZsWPlmRel0L7eg8U2w==",
  "signatureKnowledgeKeySalt" : "J/LULF2V/fqE7Dw7AZhlmA==",
  "signaturePossessionKey" : "jO89IxZs9bawvW3qlNQCzg==",
  "transportMasterKey" : "kOh0lamazBJgDLSIcZ/ZJw=="
}
```

## Specifying PowerAuth Protocol Version

Command line tool supports following PowerAuth protocol versions:
- Version `3.1` (default)
- Version `3.0`
- Version `2.1`
- Version `2.0`

You can specify the version of protocol you want to use using parameter `version`. The version affects used cryptography, for example version `2` activations use custom encryption, while version `3` activations use an integrated ECIES scheme.

## Supported Use-Cases

### Create Activation

Use this method to create a new activation using an activation code.

```bash
java -jar powerauth-java-cmd.jar \
    --url "http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server" \
    --status-file "/tmp/pa_status.json" \
    --config-file "/tmp/pamk.json" \
    --method "create" \
    --password "1234" \
    --activation-code "F3CCT-FNOUS-GEVJF-O3HMV"
```

Uses the `create` method to activate a PowerAuth Reference client by calling the PowerAuth Standard RESTful API endpoint `/pa/v3/activation/create` hosted on root URL `http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server` with an activation code `F3CCT-FNOUS-GEVJF-O3HMV`. Reads and stores the client status from the `/tmp/pa_status.json` file. Uses master public key and application identifiers stored in the `/tmp/pamk.json` file. Stores the knowledge related derived key using a given password `1234`.

For backward compatibility, the tool also supports the `prepare` method as an alias to the `create` method, however this method is already deprecated. Usage of this method prints a deprecation warning.

_Note: If a `--password` option is not provided, this method requires interactive console input of the password, in order to encrypt the knowledge related signature key._

### Get Activation Status

Use this method to obtain information about existing activation.

```bash
java -jar powerauth-java-cmd.jar \
    --url "http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server" \
    --status-file "/tmp/pa_status.json" \
    --config-file "/tmp/pamk.json" \
    --method "status"
```

Uses the `status` method to get the activation status for the activation ID stored in the status file `/tmp/pa_status.json`, by calling the PowerAuth Standard RESTful API endpoint `/pa/v3/activation/status` hosted on root URL `http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server`. Uses the master public key and application identifiers stored in the `/tmp/pamk.json` file.

### Remove the Activation

Use to remove the activation on the server.

```bash
java -jar powerauth-java-cmd.jar \
    --url "http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server" \
    --status-file "/tmp/pa_status.json" \
    --config-file "/tmp/pamk.json" \
    --method "remove" \
    --password "1234"
```

Uses the `remove` method to remove activation with an activation ID stored in the status file `/tmp/pa_status.json`, by calling the PowerAuth Standard RESTful API endpoint `/pa/v3/activation/remove` hosted on root URL `http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server`. Uses the master public key and application identifiers stored in the `/tmp/pamk.json` file. Unlocks the knowledge related signing key using `1234` as a password.

_Note: If a `--password` option is not provided, this method requires interactive console input of the password, in order to unlock the knowledge related signature key._

### Validate the Signature

Use this method to send signer GET or POST requests to given URL with provided data.

```bash
java -jar powerauth-java-cmd.jar \
    --url "http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server/pa/v3/signature/validate" \
    --status-file "/tmp/pa_status.json" \
    --config-file "/tmp/pamk.json" \
    --method "sign" \
    --http-method "POST" \
    --endpoint "/pa/signature/validate" \
    --signature-type "possession_knowledge" \
    --data-file "/tmp/request.json" \
    --password "1234"
```

Uses the `sign` method to compute a signature for given data using anÂ activation record associated with an activation ID stored in the status file `/tmp/pa_status.json`. Calls an authenticated endpoint `http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server/pa/v3/signature/validate` that is identified by an identifier `/pa/signature/validate` (by convention the same as the endpoint name after the main context except the version). The endpoint must be published by the application - see [Verify Signature](https://github.com/wultra/powerauth-restful-integration/blob/develop/docs/RESTful-API-for-Spring.md#verify-signatures). Uses the master public key and application identifiers stored in the `/tmp/pamk.json` file. Uses HTTP method `POST`, `possession_knowledge` signature type and takes the request data from a file `/tmp/request.json`. Unlocks the knowledge related signing key using `1234` as a password.

_Note: If a `--password` option is not provided, this method requires interactive console input of the password, in order to unlock the knowledge related signature key._

In case you are validating signature on requests that require authenticated session, use `--http-header` option:

You can use the `dry-run` parameter, in this case the step is stopped right after signing the request body and preparing appropriate headers.

```bash
java -jar powerauth-java-cmd.jar \
    --url "http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server/pa/v3/signature/validate" \
    --status-file "/tmp/pa_status.json" \
    --config-file "/tmp/pamk.json" \
    --method "sign" \
    --http-method "POST" \
    --http-header Cookie="JSESSIONID=D0A047F9E8A9928386A5B34AB6343C30"
    --endpoint "/pa/signature/validate" \
    --signature-type "possession_knowledge" \
    --data-file "/tmp/request.json" \
    --password "1234"
```

_Note: The choice of signature version is determined by presence of `ctrData` in status file (present since version `3.0`)._

### Unlock the Secure Vault

Use this method to test secure vault unlocking.

```bash
java -jar powerauth-java-cmd.jar \
    --url "http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server" \
    --status-file "/tmp/pa_status.json" \
    --config-file "/tmp/pamk.json" \
    --method "unlock" \
    --signature-type "possession_knowledge" \
    --password "1234" \
    --reason "NOT_SPECIFIED"
```

Uses the `unlock` method to unlock the secure vault for an activation with activation ID stored in the status file `/tmp/pa_status.json`, by calling the PowerAuth Standard RESTful API endpoint `/pa/v3/vault/unlock` hosted on root URL `http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server`. Uses the master public key and application identifiers stored in the `/tmp/pamk.json` file. Unlocks the knowledge related signing key using `1234` as a password. The reason why vault is being unlocked is `NOT_SPECIFIED`.

_Note: If a `--password` option is not provided, this method requires interactive console input of the password, in order to unlock the knowledge related signature key._

### Create Token

Create a static token which can be used for repeated requests to data resources which support token based authentication.

```bash
java -jar powerauth-java-cmd.jar \
    --url "http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server" \
    --status-file "/tmp/pa_status.json" \
    --config-file "/tmp/pamk.json" \
    --method "create-token" \
    --signature-type "possession_knowledge" \
    --password "1234"
```

Uses the `create-token` method to create a token for an activation with activation ID stored in the status file `/tmp/pa_status.json`, by calling the PowerAuth Standard RESTful API endpoint `/pa/v3/token/create` hosted on root URL `http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server`. Uses the server public key, transport key and application identifiers stored in the `/tmp/pamk.json` file. Unlocks the knowledge related signing key using `1234` as a password. 

_Note: If a `--password` option is not provided, this method requires interactive console input of the password, in order to unlock the knowledge related signature key._

### Validate Token

Use a previously created token to authorize an operation.

```bash
java -jar powerauth-java-cmd.jar \
    --url "http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server/api/auth/token" \
    --status-file "/tmp/pa_status.json" \
    --config-file "/tmp/pamk.json" \
    --method "validate-token" \
    --http-method "POST" \
    --data-file "/tmp/request.json" \
    --token-id "66b8b981-a89d-4fc2-bd49-1c05f937a6f2" \
    --token-secret "xfb1NUXAPbvDZK8qyNVGyw=="
```

Uses the `validate-token` method for an activation with activation ID stored in the status file `/tmp/pa_status.json`, by calling an endpoint `/api/auth/token` hosted on root URL `http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server`. The endpoint must be published by the application -- see [Token Based Authentication](https://github.com/wultra/powerauth-restful-integration/blob/develop/docs/RESTful-API-for-Spring.md#use-token-based-authentication). Uses the application identifiers stored in the `/tmp/pamk.json` file. The request data is taken from file `/tmp/request.json`.

You can use the `dry-run` parameter, in this case the step is stopped right after signing the request body and preparing appropriate headers.

### Remove Token

Remove a previously created token.

```bash
java -jar powerauth-java-cmd.jar \
    --url "http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server" \
    --status-file "/tmp/pa_status.json" \
    --config-file "/tmp/pamk.json" \
    --method "remove-token" \
    --signature-type "possession_knowledge" \
    --password "1234" \
    --token-id "66b8b981-a89d-4fc2-bd49-1c05f937a6f2"
```

Uses the `remove-token` method to remove a previously created token for an activation with activation ID stored in the status file `/tmp/pa_status.json`, by calling the PowerAuth Standard RESTful API endpoint `/pa/v3/token/remove` hosted on root URL `http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server`. Uses the application identifiers stored in the `/tmp/pamk.json` file to create the request signature. Unlocks the knowledge related signing key using `1234` as a password. 

_Note: If a `--password` option is not provided, this method requires interactive console input of the password, in order to unlock the knowledge related signature key._

### Custom Attributes for Activation

Use this method to create an activation using the custom identity attributes.

```bash
java -jar powerauth-java-cmd.jar \
    --url "http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server" \
    --status-file "/tmp/pa_status.json" \
    --config-file "/tmp/pamk.json" \
    --method "create-custom" \
    --identity-file "/tmp/identity.json" \
    --custom-attributes-file "/tmp/custom-attributes.json" \
    --password "1234"
```

Uses the `create-custom` method to activate a PowerAuth Reference client by calling activation endpoint with identity attributes stored in `/tmp/identity.json` file and custom activation attributes stored in `/tmp/custom-attributes.json` file. Reads and stores the client status from the `/tmp/pa_status.json` file. Uses master public key and application identifiers stored in the `/tmp/pamk.json` file. Stores the knowledge related derived key using a given password `1234`.

There is a required format of both `identity.json` and `custom-attributes.json` files. The `custom-attributes.json` file may be any JSON file representing an object (at least, the file must contain `{}` string). The `identity.json` file must be a simple JSON object with identity attributes stored as string key-value, for example:

```json
{
    "username": "johndoe01",
    "password": "s3cR!7"
}
```

_Note: If a `--password` option is not provided, this method requires interactive console input of the password, in order to encrypt the knowledge related signature key._

_Note: In protocol version `2.x` you need to provide a full URL in `--url` parameter, pointing to the custom activation endpoint._

### Send Encrypted Data to Server

Use this method to send encrypted data to the server.

```bash
java -jar powerauth-java-cmd.jar \
    --url "http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server-spring/exchange" \
    --config-file "config.json" \
    --method "encrypt" \
    --data-file "request.json" \
    --scope "application"
```

Uses the `encrypt` method to encrypt data in `request.json` file using ECIES encryption. The encryption uses `application` scope, you can use the `activation` option to switch to activation scope. 
The encrypted data is sent to specified endpoint URL. The endpoint which receives encrypted data needs to decrypt the data and return encrypted response back to the client. The cmd line tool receives the encrypted response from server, decrypts it and prints it into the command line.

### Send Signed and Encrypted Data to Server

Use this method to send signed and encrypted data to the server.

```bash
java -jar powerauth-java-cmd.jar \
    --url "http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server-spring/exchange/v3/signed" \
    --status-file "pa_status.json" \
    --config-file "config.json" \
    --method "sign-encrypt" \
    --http-method "POST" \
    --endpoint "/exchange/v3/signed" \
    --signature-type "possession_knowledge" \
    --data-file "request.json" \
    --password "1234"
```

The data in `request.json` file is signed and encrypted using ECIES encryption. See chapter [Validate the Signature](#validate-the-signature) which describes signature parameters.
The encrypted data is sent to specified endpoint URL. The endpoint which receives encrypted data needs to decrypt the data, verify data signature and return encrypted response back to the client. The cmd line tool receives the encrypted response from server, decrypts it and prints it into the command line.

### Start Upgrade

Use this method to start upgrade of a version `2` activation to version `3`.

```
java -jar powerauth-java-cmd.jar \
    --url "http://localhost:8080/powerauth-restful-server" \
    --status-file "pa_status.json" \
    --config-file "config.json" \
    --method "start-upgrade"
```

The start upgrade request is sent to the server. The server response with generated hash based counter value `ctrData` which is later used for the first version `3.0` signature verification during commit upgrade.

### Commit Upgrade

Use this method to commit upgrade of a version `2` activation to version `3`.

```
java -jar powerauth-java-cmd.jar \
    --url "http://localhost:8080/powerauth-webflow" \
    --status-file "pa_status.json" \
    --config-file "config.json" \
    --method "commit-upgrade"
```

The commit upgrade request is sent to the server including a version `3.0` signature. The server verifies the request signature and commits the upgrade of activation to version `3`.
